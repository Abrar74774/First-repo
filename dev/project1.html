    <p style="text-align: justify;">This page is made to find out my limitations in coding. Even if I learned
    quite a bit from the internet, I forgot most of them, which I am finding out through coding without 
    laid out instructions (like I did while I was learning from the internet.). This is my first project to be pushed to GitHub. </p>
